# **Web Development Practice Repository**

This repository is dedicated to my **Web Development practice journey**.  
Here, I will store all the **practice files, small projects, and experiments** I create while learning **HTML, CSS**, and other necessary web technologies.

## 📂 **Repository Structure**

- **HTML Practice** → Basic structure, elements, forms, tables, and semantic tags.

## 🎯 **Purpose**

The main goals of this repository are to:  

1. Strengthen my **fundamentals in HTML and CSS**.  
2. Practice building **modern layouts and designs**.  
3. Create a **personal collection of reference code** that I can reuse later.  
4. Track my **learning progress** over time.
